The “question behind the question” often goes something like this: what you’re saying about APEST sounds good, but if it’s that important, shouldn’t we see it being worked out in other parts of the New Testament? This is a great question, and deserves a good response. (For a more detailed description of the APEST giftings of apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd, and teacher, <a href=\"\\&quot;https://trimtabguide.wordpress.com/2021/08/10/what-is-apest/\\&quot;\">click here</a>)</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-dda685b e-flex e-con-boxed e-con e-parent\" data-id=\"dda685b\" data-element_type=\"container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"e-con-inner\">\n\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-d359c84 e-con-full e-flex e-con e-child\" data-id=\"d359c84\" data-element_type=\"container\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-901383b elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"901383b\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"\\&quot;wp-block-heading\\&quot;\">APEST in Antioch</h2><p data-adtags-visited=\"\\&quot;true\\&quot;\">The most condensed and explicit picture of APEST in the book of Acts is in the church at Antioch.

First, there’s the extension of the mission to new geographical areas (Phonecia, Cyprus, and Antioch.) But this form of apostolic ministry seems to be more of the <a href=\"\\&quot;https://form.jotform.com/212735519063152\\&quot;\">Petrine expression</a> as it was initially focused exclusively on the those practicing a more purist form of Judaism. But eventually the mission crosses over from the more conservative form of Judaism to those Jews who were practicing a form of Judaism that accommodated certain aspects of Greek culture (deemed by the more conservative form of Judaism as being polluted). While still remaining largely a Jewish focused mission at this point, it still represents a broadening of the scope of their mission in that region.</p><p data-adtags-visited=\"\\&quot;true\\&quot;\">The evangelistic function is clearly seen in the actual language of vs 20 where it says they were “preaching” the Lord Jesus. The word here in the original language is “<a href=\"\\&quot;https://biblehub.com/interlinear/acts/11-20.htm\\&quot;\" target=\"\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;\" rel=\"\\&quot;noreferrer\">evangelized</a>“. The result of this apostolic and evangelistic ministry is that a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord, which gave birth to the church in Antioch.</p><h3 class=\"\\&quot;wp-block-heading\\&quot;\">Apostolic and Prophetic</h3><p class=\"\\&quot;wp-block-heading\\&quot;\"><em><sup>22 </sup><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Then news of these things came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch. </span><sup>23 </sup><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">When he came and had seen the grace of God, he was glad, and encouraged them all that with purpose of heart they should continue with the Lord.</span><cite style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Acts 11:22-23</cite></em></p><p>When the apostles in Jerusalem heard about a new church emerging in Antioch they sent Barnabas to, presumably, scope out the situation and offer support (similar to what Peter and John did in Samaria in Acts 8). The language of “as far as Antioch” implies he was sent to “inspect” the new churches that were emerging between Jerusalem and Antioch as a result of the dispersion in Acts 8. Antioch was the largest city that had the closest proximity to the northern most boundary of the Holy Land. In more ways than one, the church at Antioch would function as a church at the “edge” for the remainder of the 1st century.</p><p data-adtags-visited=\"\\&quot;true\\&quot;\">We see the apostolic function at work when the church sends representatives to “oversee” the health and sustainability of the newly emerging churches. This role of “overseeing” the movement is an apostolic function mentioned in Acts 1:20.</p><p data-adtags-visited=\"\\&quot;true\\&quot;\">And although Barnabas is functionally identified as an apostle while on a frontier mission with Paul in Acts 14:14, it’s more likely Barnabas was an Ephesians 4:11 prophet based on the listing of names in Acts 13:1. Also, his name in Aramaic and Hebrew means “son of a prophet.”</p><p data-adtags-visited=\"\\&quot;true\\&quot;\">We see this prophetic function coming out in the way Luke describes Barnabas’ ministry at Antioch as encouraging the people with “purpose of heart to continue with the Lord.” The word “<a href=\"\\&quot;https://biblehub.com/interlinear/acts/11-23.htm\\&quot;\">continue</a>” in the original language means to actively pursue a relationship of abiding, staying, or remaining with. The implication here is that Barnabas is encouraging people to enter into a deep and abiding communion with the Lord – to connect with the Lord in their hearts, not just their heads. This is a characteristic feature of all genuine, mature prophetic ministry.</p><h3 class=\"\\&quot;wp-block-heading\\&quot;\">Evangelistic</h3><p class=\"\\&quot;wp-block-heading\\&quot;\"><em><sup>24 </sup><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord. </span><cite>Acts 11:24</cite></em></p><p data-adtags-visited=\"\\&quot;true\\&quot;\">The direct result of Barnabas’ prophetic ministry at the church in Antioch appears to be an organic participation in evangelistic ministry, one that was characterized by people being added “to the Lord.” Notice the prophetic emphasis on people’s conversion being characterized as being added to the “Lord” and not the “church”, as in Acts 2:47. This is a characteristic way for how prophets see the end goal of evangelism – not just adding people to the group, but bringing people into a direct, unhindered relationship with the Lord.</p><h3 class=\"\\&quot;wp-block-heading\\&quot;\">Teaching</h3><p class=\"\\&quot;wp-block-heading\\&quot;\"><sup>25 </sup><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Then Barnabas departed for Tarsus to seek Saul. </span><sup>26 </sup><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for a whole year they assembled with the church and taught a great many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch. </span><cite>Acts 11:25-26</cite></p></div><div><p data-adtags-visited=\"\\&quot;true\\&quot;\">The newly founded church in Antioch gathered for an entire year to be taught by Paul and Barnabas. The word “<a href=\"\\&quot;https://biblehub.com/interlinear/ephesians/4-11.htm\\&quot;\">taught</a>” here in the original language shares the same root word for teacher in Ephesians 4:11.</p><h3 class=\"\\&quot;wp-block-heading\\&quot;\">Prophetic and Shepherding</h3><p class=\"\\&quot;wp-block-heading\\&quot;\"><em><sup>27 </sup><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">And in these days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch. </span><sup>28 </sup><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Then one of them, named Agabus, stood up and showed by the Spirit that there was going to be a great famine throughout all the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius Caesar. </span><sup>29 </sup><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Then the disciples, each according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brethren dwelling in Judea. </span><sup>30 </sup><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">This they also did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. </span><cite>Acts 11:27-30</cite></em></p><p data-adtags-visited=\"\\&quot;true\\&quot;\">Here we see the prophetic function operating in a trans-local way. In the same way Barnabas was sent from Jerusalem to Antioch, more prophets come from Jerusalem to participate in the life of the Antioch church. What’s interesting is that the prophet Agabus gives a prophetic word to the whole church about a coming famine, and the whole church responds to that word in a very practical way.</p><p data-adtags-visited=\"\\&quot;true\\&quot;\">The shepherding function comes into the fore here as the Antioch church tends to needs of a “flock” within the network of churches they are a part of.</p><h3 class=\"\\&quot;wp-block-heading\\&quot;\">Prophetic and Apostolic</h3><p class=\"\\&quot;wp-block-heading\\&quot;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Now in the church that was at Antioch there were certain prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. </span><sup>2 </sup><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, “Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” </span><sup>3 </sup><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Then, having fasted and prayed, and laid hands on them, they sent </span>them<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> away. </span><sup>4 </sup>So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus. <cite>Acts 13:1-4</cite></em></p><p data-adtags-visited=\"\\&quot;true\\&quot;\">Although Luke only identifies “certain” prophets and teachers in the Antioch church, we know there were other APEST giftings present in the church there. How do we know this? Because Paul himself was there!</p><p data-adtags-visited=\"\\&quot;true\\&quot;\">The prophetic function is clearly seen in the church focusing on blessing the Lord, fasting, and being attentive to the voice of God. What flows out of this prophetic environment is the separating of Barnabas and Paul by the Holy Spirit for a specific assignment, followed by the church releasing them into that assignment with their blessing.</p><h2 class=\"\\&quot;wp-block-heading\\&quot;\">Connecting the Dots</h2><p data-adtags-visited=\"\\&quot;true\\&quot;\">There’s a few interesting things to notice about this portrait of the church in Antioch. First, we see all five APEST functions at work. And with the exception of the shepherding function (which is directly implied by their taking up a collection to provide for the needs of the saints in Jerusalem), each APEST function is explicitly named as either a verb or noun in the narrative.</p><p data-adtags-visited=\"\\&quot;true\\&quot;\">Another important thing to take note of is the role that prophetic ministry plays in the churches evangelistic and apostolic ministry. Paul categorizes apostolic and prophetic ministry as foundational to the church in Ephesians 2:20. In this portrait of the Antioch church, both evangelistic, shepherding, and apostolic ministry flowed directly out of prophetic environments where people were, 1.) called to enter more deeply into close and consistent communion with the Lord, 2.) exposed to reputable prophets and their real time revelations, and 3.) immersed in worship, prayer, and fasting.</p><p data-adtags-visited=\"\\&quot;true\\&quot;\">Is APEST present in the book of Acts? This short portrait of the Antioch church would answer with a confident, “Yes!” But it’s not just the church in Antioch. An intentional reading of the book of Acts would reveal that the APEST functions were – explicitly and implicitly – at work within the emerging Christian movement.</p><h2 class=\"\\&quot;wp-block-heading\\&quot;\">Awareness</h2><ol><li>Where do you see the APEST functions at work in the book of Acts?</li><li>Do you see each APEST function at work in the local or trans-local expression of the church you are a part of of? Why or why not?</li><li>Which APEST function seems to get the most space to function in the expression of church you are participating in?
