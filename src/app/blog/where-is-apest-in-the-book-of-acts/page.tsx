            <p>A question I often get asked in our coaching groups is: where do we see APEST functioning in the book of Acts? The “question behind the question” often goes something like this: what you’re saying about APEST sounds good, but if it’s that important, shouldn’t we see it being worked out in other parts of the New Testament? This is a great question, and deserves a good response. (For a more detailed description of the APEST giftings of apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd, and teacher, click here)\\n\\nThe most condensed and explicit picture of APEST in the book of Acts is in the church at Antioch. So let’s take a look at two passages:\\n\\nWe see several apostolic functions at work here. First, there’s the extension of the mission to new geographical areas (Phonecia, Cyprus, and Antioch.) But this form of apostolic ministry seems to be more of the Petrine expression as it was initially focused exclusively on the those practicing a more purist form of Judaism. But eventually the mission crosses over from the more conservative form of Judaism to those Jews who were practicing a form of Judaism that accommodated certain aspects of Greek culture (deemed by the more conservative form of Judaism as being polluted). While still remaining largely a Jewish focused mission at this point, it still represents a broadening of the scope of their mission in that region.\\n\\nThe evangelistic function is clearly seen in the actual language of vs 20 where it says they were “preaching” the Lord Jesus. The word here in the original language is “evangelized“. The result of this apostolic and evangelistic ministry is that a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord, which gave birth to the church in Antioch.\\n\\nWhen the apostles in Jerusalem heard about a new church emerging in Antioch they sent Barnabas to, presumably, scope out the situation and offer support (similar to what Peter and John did in Samaria in Acts 8). The language of “as far as Antioch” implies he was sent to “inspect” the new churches that were emerging between Jerusalem and Antioch as a result of the dispersion in Acts 8. Antioch was the largest city that had the closest proximity to the northern most boundary of the Holy Land. In more ways than one, the church at Antioch would function as a church at the “edge” for the remainder of the 1st century.\\n\\nWe see the apostolic function at work when the church sends representatives to “oversee” the health and sustainability of the newly emerging churches. This role of “overseeing” the movement is an apostolic function mentioned in Acts 1:20.\\n\\nAnd although Barnabas is functionally identified as an apostle while on a frontier mission with Paul in Acts 14:14, it’s more likely Barnabas was an Ephesians 4:11 prophet based on the listing of names in Acts 13:1. Also, his name in Aramaic and Hebrew means “son of a prophet.”\\n\\nWe see this prophetic function coming out in the way Luke describes Barnabas’ ministry at Antioch as encouraging the people with “purpose of heart to continue with the Lord.” The word “continue” in the original language means to actively pursue a relationship of abiding, staying, or remaining with. The implication here is that Barnabas is encouraging people to enter into a deep and abiding communion with the Lord – to connect with the Lord in their hearts, not just their heads. This is a characteristic feature of all genuine, mature prophetic ministry.\\n\\nThe direct result of Barnabas’ prophetic ministry at the church in Antioch appears to be an organic participation in evangelistic ministry, one that was characterized by people being added “to the Lord.” Notice the prophetic emphasis on people’s conversion being characterized as being added to the “Lord” and not the “church”, as in Acts 2:47. This is a characteristic way for how prophets see the end goal of evangelism – not just adding people to the group, but bringing people into a direct, unhindered relationship with the Lord.\\n\\nThe newly founded church in Antioch gathered for an entire year to be taught by Paul and Barnabas. The word “taught” here in the original language shares the same root word for teacher in Ephesians 4:11.\\n\\nHere we see the prophetic function operating in a trans-local way. In the same way Barnabas was sent from Jerusalem to Antioch, more prophets come from Jerusalem to participate in the life of the Antioch church. What’s interesting is that the prophet Agabus gives a prophetic word to the whole church about a coming famine, and the whole church responds to that word in a very practical way.\\n\\nThe shepherding function comes into the fore here as the Antioch church tends to needs of a “flock” within the network of churches they are a part of.\\n\\nAlthough Luke only identifies “certain” prophets and teachers in the Antioch church, we know there were other APEST giftings present in the church there. How do we know this? Because Paul himself was there!\\n\\nThe prophetic function is clearly seen in the church focusing on blessing the Lord, fasting, and being attentive to the voice of God. What flows out of this prophetic environment is the separating of Barnabas and Paul by the Holy Spirit for a specific assignment, followed by the church releasing them into that assignment with their blessing.\\n\\nThere’s a few interesting things to notice about this portrait of the church in Antioch. First, we see all five APEST functions at work. And with the exception of the shepherding function (which is directly implied by their taking up a collection to provide for the needs of the saints in Jerusalem), each APEST function is explicitly named as either a verb or noun in the narrative.\\n\\nAnother important thing to take note of is the role that prophetic ministry plays in the churches evangelistic and apostolic ministry. Paul categorizes apostolic and prophetic ministry as foundational to the church in Ephesians 2:20. In this portrait of the Antioch church, both evangelistic, shepherding, and apostolic ministry flowed directly out of prophetic environments where people were, 1.) called to enter more deeply into close and consistent communion with the Lord, 2.) exposed to reputable prophets and their real time revelations, and 3.) immersed in worship, prayer, and fasting.\\n\\nIs APEST present in the book of Acts? This short portrait of the Antioch church would answer with a confident, “Yes!” But it’s not just the church in Antioch. An intentional reading of the book of Acts would reveal that the APEST functions were – explicitly and implicitly – at work within the emerging Christian movement.</p>
