I’m excited to move forward and wanted to share a concise plan for how I’d like to publish this project across formats and channels. Below is the high-level summary with a short note on what each item means.

Channels & formats

My site: downloadable PDF (accessible, tagged) and an interactive WebBook version hosted in my learning hub/website (as well as on Chris' site?).

Amazon Kindle: publish via EPUB upload to KDP (Amazon converts to Kindle).

Apple/Kobo/Google: distribute a standards-compliant EPUB 3 to these stores.

Paperback: print-on-demand via KDP Print and IngramSpark for wider bookstore/library reach. Or...I may have a printer who can do it cheaper and therefore save money. I would package it and ship myself. 

SKUs (distinct product packages)

Lite (Free PDF): a shorter, email-gated lead magnet version.

Standard (EPUB + PDF): the full ebook download (also mirrored to the major stores).

Pro (Interactive WebBook Bundle): web version with progress, notes, end-of-chapter quizzes, and an “Ask Tim” AI helper; includes a workbook PDF and a couple of private videos.

Deluxe (Print + Digital + Voucher): paperback + EPUB/PDF + a voucher for a short coaching debrief.

Team Pack (10 seats + facilitator kit): web access for teams plus leader guide, slide deck, and a simple team dashboard.

Reader protection (light-touch)

PDFs: add a small footer/watermark with buyer name/email/order ID (“light stamping”) to discourage sharing.

Kindle DRM: leave OFF to keep access simple and reduce support friction.

Store→Hub bridge (bonuses that bring readers into my ecosystem)

Include QR codes/shortlinks and a companion access code so store buyers can claim a bonus workbook, private videos, an assessment coupon, or a coaching debrief voucher inside my hub (creates an account and lets me support them better).

What I’ll provide
Final manuscript in DOCX with styled headings; images with alt-text; back-cover copy and author bio; any front/back matter.

Initial pricing targets and copy for listings.

What I’m hoping you can handle
Accessible EPUB 3 creation and tagged PDF production.

KDP + IngramSpark setup (metadata, categories/BISACs, pricing, territories).

Store uploads (Apple/Kobo/Google) and basic QA/proofs.

Light PDF stamping workflow.

Simple guidance on ISBNs (use yours or mine) and a proposed production timeline.

Fantastic—based on your picks (B; 1,2,3,4,5; X), here’s a tight production plan + funnel map you can hand to your AI agent (and a short read-aloud script at the end).

Voice Briefing Script (read this to your AI agent)

“Hi, I’m Tim. I want to produce my book in five SKUs and run a free-to-paid funnel.

Channels: My own site with a tagged PDF and an Interactive WebBook, plus stores: Amazon Kindle and Apple/Kobo/Google using EPUB3, and a paperback via KDP and IngramSpark.

Protection: Put light stamping (buyer name/email/order ID) on all paid PDFs. Leave Kindle DRM OFF.

SKUs:

Lite (Free PDF) as an email-gated lead magnet.

Standard (EPUB + PDF) as a paid download and also listed in stores; on my thank-you page this is a $9 tripwire.

Pro (Interactive WebBook Bundle) inside my hub with progress, highlights/notes, end-of-chapter quizzes, and an ‘Ask Tim’ AI that is page-aware, cites sources, summarizes chapters, suggests next steps, and generates practice prompts; include a workbook PDF and 2–3 private videos.

Deluxe (Print + Digital + Voucher): paperback + EPUB/PDF + a coaching debrief voucher.

Team Pack (10 seats + facilitator kit): WebBook seats, leader guide, slide deck, team prompts, and a team dashboard.

Accessibility: Meet full accessibility for PDF, EPUB, and WebBook at launch.

WebBook build: Mobile-first, WCAG 2.1 AA, chapter ToC, search, progress bar, highlights/notes export, quizzes with scores, and ‘Ask Tim’ AI as described. Track analytics events for chapter views, quizzes, notes, AI queries, and CTA clicks.

Store bridge: Add a QR at the end of the book and a companion site access code in print. The companion landing grants a bonus workbook, private videos, an assessment coupon, and a coaching debrief voucher after they create a free account.

Funnel:

Lead magnet → TY page offers Standard at $9; order bump for a $9 workbook; 1-click upsell to Pro at $39–$59.

Store buyers use QR/shortlinks to claim extras in my hub and are offered Pro or All-Access.

After reading or finishing Pro, prompt to book a coaching debrief.

Automations: Use Mailchimp. Single opt-in for downloads; double opt-in for newsletter and EU/UK. Nurture sequences for Lite, Standard, and Pro buyers; store-claim sequence; and a conversion sequence to coaching debrief. Tag all behaviors and purchases. Send me an email alert for hot leads.

Pricing to test: Standard $14–$19 list, $9 tripwire; Pro $39 vs $59; Deluxe $79 vs $99; Team Pack $249 vs $399; bump $9 vs $12.

If any detail is missing, use sensible defaults consistent with this plan. Everything must be accessible, responsive, secure, and integrate with my hub’s accounts, analytics, and entitlements.”
